We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia&#x2019;s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (&#x201c;FCC Guidelines&#x201d;) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.</span><span style=\"color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;, sans-serif;min-width:fit-content;\"> </span></p><p style=\"text-indent:0.0%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:9.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;, sans-serif;min-width:fit-content;\">In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs&#x2019; expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants&#x2019; motion to exclude the plaintiffs&#x2019; general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court.  A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants&#x2019; motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs&#x2019; experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs&#x2019; experts from testifying.</span></p><p style=\"text-indent:0.0%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:13.5pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:left;\"><span style=\"background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;, sans-serif;min-width:fit-content;\">Irish Data Protection Commission Matter</span></p><p style=\"text-indent:0.0%;font-size:10.0pt;margin-top:9.0pt;font-family:Times New Roman;margin-bottom:0.0pt;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);color:rgba(0,0,0,1);white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:normal;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;, sans-serif;min-width:fit-content;\">In 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (&#x201c;IDPC&#x201d;) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn&#x2019;s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection Regulation (&#x201c;GDPR&#x201d;).
